						Time passing<br>
                        Time, time passing<br>
                        You wanted to know what the hype was all about<br>
                        So I came back<br>
                        Then we fucked a little bit and I was out<br>
                        Did not say "bye"<br>
                        It was worth it (ooh, it was)<br>
                        I would do it again (hey)<br>
                        I know you hurt me, but (hey)<br>
                        This is more than a friendship<br>
                        Now, I made it awkward<br>
                        Why did you let me do it?<br>
                        I made it, I make it awkward (hey, hey)<br>
                        He wasn't ready for it (hey, hey)<br>
                        But can we still love on each other?<br>
                        Can we still touch on each other?<br>
                        Can we still not judge each other?<br>
                        You know, you know I make it awkward<br>
                        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						I cannot love everybody, but you isn't anybody<br>
                        You look at me differеnt, so I let you see my body (body, body, body)<br>
                        Now we don't seem to get along<br>
                        Now I rеgret it all<br>
                        Still, it was worth it<br>
                        I would do it again<br>
                        I know you hurt me, but<br>
                        It is just deeper than friendship<br>
                        Now, let's keep it awkward<br>
                        I think we're ready for it, yeah, mmh<br>
                        Let's keep it awkward<br>
                        I know I'm ready for it, you feel me?<br>
                        Can we still love on each other?<br>
                        Can we still touch on each other?<br>
                        Can we still not judge each other?<br>
